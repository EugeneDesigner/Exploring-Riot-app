#Riot app tutorial


Following the great tutorial made by [STREAMDATA.io](http://streamdata.io/blog/exploring-riot-js-part1/), I created a simple single-page app with a dummy database and straight-forward views. My main priority was to learn how to use
Riot.js for my planned web application I will do very soon. So, *follow* my [Github account](https://github.com/EugeneDesigner) to find out what this app will be about. Expect some cool stuff!
